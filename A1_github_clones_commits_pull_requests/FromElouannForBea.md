# Elouann's recommendations for Bea

One quotation I like : "Aimer c'est savoir dire je t'aime sans parler." - Victor Hugo
A food or flavour I don‘t like : I don't like avocado
A recommendation for something and why : We have to watch the movie "The Spanish Apartment" because it's a great movie and it's in French.
One German language word I have learned : "Scheiße"
